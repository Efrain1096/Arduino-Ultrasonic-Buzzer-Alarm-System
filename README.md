# Arduino-Ultrasonic-Buzzer-Alarm-System

# Author: Efrain Vasques

# General Overview:
Persnonal Project where I programmed and wired an embedded system using an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller in C/C++ to detect an object crossing the line-of-sight of an HC-SR04 sensor at a set programmed distance value. Using an LCD1602 display, the approximate distance to the nearest object is shown. If an object or person crosses the sensor and reflects the ultrasonic waves, it triggers an alarm sounding off a passive buzzer and LEDs start blinking until the system has been reset or turned off.
